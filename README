This is a Software Defined Radio(SDR) project implementing a DVB-T2 receiver.

The project was created using the Qt5 framework.
To build the project, you need to install
the library FFTW3: http://www.fftw.org

Supported devices:
1. SdrPlay (need to install API/HW driver – V2.*(but not V3.*) from https://www.sdrplay.com) 
    configure with qmake sdrplay=1 to enable SdrPlay support
2. AirSpy (need to install libusb-1.0 from https://libusb.info)
3. PlutoSDR (Only Linux and firmware 0.31. The program makes a temporary kernel patch for plutosdr-fw 0.31)
4. HackRF (requires libhackrf from https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf)
    configure with qmake hackrf=1 to enable HackRF support
5. Various RSP1/MSi SDR clones. (requires libmirisdr-4, better this fork https://github.com/vladisslav2011/libmirisdr-4)
    configure with qmake miri=1 to enable HackRF support
6. Ettus USRP via libuhd (B200. B210 tested)
    configure with qmake usrp=1 to enable Ettus USRP support.

Addidtional configuration options:
MIRI_INCLUDE_DIR, string, point to location of mirisdr.h file
MIRI_LIB_DIR, string, point to location of libmirisdr.so/libmirisdr.a
USRP_INCLUDE_DIR, string, point to location of libuhd include dir
USRP_LIB_DIR, string, point to location of libuhd.so/

Received DVB-T2 signal parameters:
1. SISO and one RT-TX
2. 8MHz 16K or 32K only (32K tested)
3. Output Transport Stream(TS) (HEM mode tested)
Not supported:
1. FEF part
2. T2-Lite


Tested configurations:
OS: Linux Mint 20 Ulyana 64-bit. Windows 10 22H2
Processor: Intel© Core™ i5-8600 CPU @ 3.10GHz × 6


To view the video signal, a VLC player v2.x (not v.3x) with 
udp://@:7654 parameters was used (URL)
